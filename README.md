# Nexus

**Nexus** is a lightweight employee schedule management application
designed to help teams organize shifts, track availability, and
streamline workplace planning.

## Current Status

Nexus is currently in its **early development stage**. There is no
downloadable version or full release available yet. Foundational
planning and initial development of the core scheduling features are in
progress.

## Purpose

Nexus aims to provide a simple, clear, and efficient solution for
businesses to:

-   Manage employee work schedules
-   View shift assignments in a centralized system
-   Reduce scheduling conflicts
-   Improve overall team organization

## Planned Features

-   Employee shift scheduling interface
-   Availability tracking
-   Conflict detection and notifications
-   Role-based permissions for managers and employees
-   Clean, intuitive dashboard
